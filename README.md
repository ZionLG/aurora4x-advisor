# Aurora 4X Companion

A tactical companion and visualization tool for [Aurora 4X](https://aurora4x.com/). Connects to a running Aurora instance via a C# Harmony patch, providing real-time system maps, fleet overlays, context-aware data panels, and an advisor persona system — all while Aurora remains your primary interface.

> **Status:** Actively developed. The Electron companion app, C# bridge, and real-time memory reader are functional. Advisor persona system is implemented. Dashboard with tactical map viewer, data explorer, and memory inspector are in progress.

## Important Note

This project is a **companion tool**, not a replacement client. Aurora 4X must remain visible, usable, and the primary game interface. This tool assists, enhances, and accelerates your interaction with Aurora — it does not replace it. This distinction is important and reflects the wishes of Aurora's creator, Steve Walmsley.

## How It Works

Aurora 4X is a closed-source .NET WinForms application with obfuscated type names. This project works around that:

1. **AuroraPatch** loads as a launcher, applies [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) patches to Aurora.exe at runtime
2. **AdvisorBridge** (a patch plugin) starts a WebSocket server inside the Aurora process on `ws://localhost:47842`
3. **MemoryReader** uses cached reflection to read game objects (stars, planets, fleets, ships) directly from Aurora's live memory
4. **The Electron app** connects to the bridge, reads game state, and renders companion visualizations alongside Aurora

> **Note on AuroraPatch:** The `AuroraPatch-master/` directory is a **modified fork** of the original [AuroraPatch](https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraPatch) project. The **Lib** library has been significantly extended with new components (`DatabaseManager`, `SignatureManager`, `KnowledgeBase`, `UIManager`) that provide the infrastructure AdvisorBridge depends on. **AdvisorBridge** is the new project added by this repo. The **Automation** project is from the original AuroraPatch and kept as a reference example of the patching API. The **Example** project originated from AuroraPatch but has been heavily modified into a dev tool for discovering Aurora's obfuscated types and field mappings (F12 inspector, type candidate search, GameState collection dumping). The core AuroraPatch launcher and `Patch` base class remain largely unchanged.

### Data Pipeline

Aurora's types and fields are obfuscated (e.g., type `kc` = SystemBody, field `v` = SystemBodyID). The conversion from raw memory to usable data is split across both sides:

- **C# Bridge (MemoryReader):** Reads obfuscated fields from Aurora's live objects via cached reflection, and maps them to human-readable keys before sending (`SystemBodyID`, `FleetName`, `OrbitalDistance`, etc.). Each entity type has a static `XxxFieldNameMap` dictionary in `MemoryReader.cs` that defines the obfuscated-to-readable mapping (e.g., `"v"` -> `"SystemBodyID"` for bodies, `"f"` -> `"StarID"` for stars). A shared `BuildFastFields` / `ReadMappedFields` pattern handles all types consistently.
- **Electron App:** Receives JSON with readable keys over WebSocket and renders directly — no client-side field translation needed.

## Features

### Real-Time Tactical Map Viewer

- Canvas-based system map with orbital body rendering alongside Aurora's own map
- Fleet position overlays with movement tracking

### Context-Aware Data Panels

- Fleet, planet, and system intel panels that update in real-time
- Data explorer for querying Aurora's game state without digging through menus
- Memory inspector for advanced users exploring game internals

### Live Game Date

- Real-time game date display from Aurora's TacticalMap title bar
- Pushes on every game tick and on initial connection

### Advisor Personas

- 8 built-in advisor archetypes (Nationalist, Technocrat, Communist, Monarchist, Military, Corporate, Diplomatic, Religious)
- Each shaped by Aurora's ideology stats (Xenophobia, Diplomacy, Militancy, Expansionism, etc.)
- Context-aware guidance and observation messages that match the advisor's personality
- Tutorial system that adapts to your empire's development stage

### Game Bridge

- WebSocket server embedded in the Aurora process via Harmony patching
- Uses [Fleck](https://github.com/statianzo/Fleck) for raw TCP WebSocket support (compatible with Wine/Proton for Linux users)
- Direct memory reads of game objects (systems, bodies, stars, fleets, ships) — no file polling
- **Smart SQL queries with selective save** — the `query` endpoint auto-detects `FCT_*` table names in your SQL (including JOINs and subqueries), and only refreshes the save methods that write to those tables. A query touching `FCT_Fleet` + `FCT_Ship` calls 2 methods instead of all 88, reducing UI thread freeze from seconds to milliseconds. See [SAVE_METHOD_MAPPING.md](AuroraPatch-master/SAVE_METHOD_MAPPING.md) for the full mapping.
- Push notifications on game tick (time advancement) for subscribed systems
- Quick commands that trigger visible Aurora UI actions (opening forms, clicking toolbar buttons)
- Protocol version handshake — the app warns users when the bridge DLL is outdated

### Auto-Updater

- Built-in auto-update via GitHub Releases (`electron-updater`)
- Automatic version bumping and release creation on push to main via GitHub Actions
- Builds for Windows and Linux (AppImage, deb, snap)

## Getting Started (User)

If you just want to **use** the tool with your Aurora installation:

### Prerequisites

- **Aurora 4X** C# version installed

### Setup

1. Download the latest [companion app release](https://github.com/ZionLG/aurora4x-advisor/releases/latest) for your platform (Windows installer or Linux AppImage/deb)
2. Download the latest C# bridge release
3. Place `AuroraPatch.exe`, `0Harmony.dll`, and other root-level dependencies into your Aurora 4X installation directory (next to `Aurora.exe`)
4. Place the `Lib` and `AdvisorBridge` patch folders into the `Patches/` directory
5. Launch Aurora through `AuroraPatch.exe` instead of `Aurora.exe`
6. Start the companion app — it connects to the bridge automatically

```
Your Aurora installation/
├── Aurora.exe                  # The game (untouched)
├── AuroraPatch.exe             # Launches Aurora with patches
├── 0Harmony.dll                # Harmony runtime patching library
├── Newtonsoft.Json.dll          # JSON serialization
├── System.Data.SQLite.dll       # SQLite bindings
├── EntityFramework.dll          # EF for Aurora's DB access

├── Patches/
│   ├── Lib/                    # Core patch library

│   └── AdvisorBridge/
│       ├── AdvisorBridge.dll   # WebSocket bridge plugin
│       └── Fleck.dll           # WebSocket library
└── ... (Aurora's other files)
```

### Linux (via Proton)

Aurora runs through Steam Proton on Linux. The companion app runs natively. The bridge uses Fleck (raw TCP sockets) instead of Windows HttpListener, so WebSocket connections work correctly across the Wine/Proton boundary.

## Getting Started (Developer)

If you want to **build from source** and debug:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** with pnpm
- **Visual Studio 2022** (or MSBuild) with .NET Framework 4.8 targeting pack
- **Aurora 4X** C# version installed

### C# Bridge (local dev setup)

Building the AuroraPatch project outputs `AuroraPatch.exe` into `AuroraPatch-master/AuroraPatch/bin/Debug/`. For the patcher to work, that directory needs to be a full Aurora installation — AuroraPatch looks for `Aurora.exe` and loads patches from a `Patches/` subfolder relative to itself.

1. Open `AuroraPatch-master/AuroraPatch.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Copy your entire Aurora 4X installation into `AuroraPatch-master/AuroraPatch/bin/Debug/` (everything — `Aurora.exe`, `AuroraDB.db`, `Flags/`, `Medals/`, etc.)
3. Create `Patches/` subfolders for each patch inside that same directory
4. Build and deploy with the included script (close Aurora first):
   ```
   cd AuroraPatch-master
   build-deploy.bat
   ```
   This builds the solution and copies Lib.dll + AdvisorBridge.dll into the Patches folders.
5. Run/debug `AuroraPatch.exe` from Visual Studio — it launches `Aurora.exe` from the same directory and loads patches from `Patches/`

```

### Aurora Version Support

Aurora obfuscates its type and field names, which change between versions. The project identifies versions by a SHA256 checksum of `Aurora.exe` (first 6 chars). Currently supported:

| Checksum | Notes                      |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| `chm1c7` | Older version              |
| `OdxONo` | Current development target |

To add support for a new version:

1. Run the `Example` patch and press F12 in any Aurora form to dump type discovery data
2. Add a new `else if` block in `KnowledgeBase.GetKnownTypeNames()` with the new checksum's type mappings
3. Update field name references in `MemoryReader.cs` if they changed

## Tech Stack
