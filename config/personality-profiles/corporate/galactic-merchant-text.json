      "body": "Director! {{idleLabs}} R&D facilities generating ZERO ROI - unacceptable! These assets should be developing commercial advantages: fuel efficiency, manufacturing cost reductions, civilian tech we could license to other civilizations. Faster engines mean more trade routes, better sensors mean safer shipping. Activate these facilities immediately - idle capacity is money left on the table!"

    "idle-factories": {
      "body": "Director! {{percentageIdle}}% factory utilization loss - that's money NOT being made! Idle production capacity means zero ROI on those assets. Put them to work building ships, installations, infrastructure - anything that generates returns! Commercial vessels expand trade capacity, refineries generate profit margins, infrastructure pays compound dividends. Maximize utilization NOW - idle assets are shareholder value destruction!"
